## Welcome

Welcome to the bash-toolbox project! The bash-toolbox project was born out of
the `build-tool` project, which you can learn about [here](
	https://github.com/anthony-chu/build-tool). As a result of a move towards
modularity and reusability, the `src` directory, which contained the scripts
that now reside in the bash-toolbox project, was born. It housed all of the core
functionality of the build-tool project and was reusable across all of the
various scripts within the build-tool project.

It only made sense that, as the next move towards modularity, the next step was
to migrate the contents of the build-tool `src` directory into its own
submodule. This, then, is that next step.

## Roadmap

Some upcoming features of the bash-toolbox project to look forward to:
